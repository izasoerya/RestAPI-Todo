# Paying around with Todo Apps

This repository contain program to create backend of a Todo App
using Go as the language and fiber framework. Hopefully, this 
repository could be used as learning material or reference to
make another usefull app. 

I'm using Golang with fiber-Go http framework as the backend to
achieve fast and lightweight web apps. For the frontend im only
using JavaScript with HTML and CSS since my main focus is 
creating a website that have optimal performance.

I may or may not will create the proper frontend after the
backend is finished, time will tell.

Thank you.
